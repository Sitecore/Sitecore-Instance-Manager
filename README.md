#### Solr index creation

* SIM now includes Solr support.
  * For Sitecore 8.2, this is available as a Configuration Preset during the installation wizard. 
  * For Sitecore 8.1, it is necessary to download the appropriate "Solr support package" from http://dev.sitecore.net/downloads, and to add it to SIM using the "Add Module" button on the "Modules list" screen during installation.
* This supports Solr 4 and higher. 
  * Note: For Solr 4.x, the default "collection1" is used as a template, and must be present. For Solr 5.x and higher, the configuration located
   at `server\solr\configsets\data_driven_schema_configs` is used, as it has the language support required to index non-English text.
* This module automates the following tasks:
    * Activates all Solr config files, and deactivates matching Lucene config files (same name with "Lucene" replacing "Solr"), with the following exceptions:
      * Sitecore 8.2 Solr + IOC files are not enabled.
      * Lucene default configuration files `Sitecore.ContentSearch.Lucene.DefaultIndexConfiguration.config` and `Sitecore.ContentSearch.Lucene.DefaultIndexConfiguration.Xdb.config` are not disabled.
      * The unmatched configuration file `Sitecore.Social.Lucene.Index.Analytics.Facebook.config` is disabled as required.
    * Sets core name to instance name + index name (e.g. "sc82u0_sitecore_web_index")
    * Copies configuration from "collection1" for each new core.
    * Calls Sitecore schema update wizard ("Generate the Solr Schema.xml file") for each new core.
    * Calls Solr API to create each core/collection.
    * Indexes are left empty, but can be built from Control Panel/Indexing Manager.
    * Enables Solr term support, as described [here.](https://doc.sitecore.net/sitecore_experience_platform/80/setting_up__maintaining/search_and_indexing/walkthrough_setting_up_solr#_Toc399318998)
